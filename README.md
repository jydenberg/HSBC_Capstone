# HSBC_Capstone
NLP Chatbot created as proof of concept for HSBC. 

My work was mostly with the API infrastructure using typescript. I helped to create the API using openAPI(swaggerUI) and nodeJS in typescript in order to connect the bot to the database and backend micro-services. I also integrated googlemaps API, designed calculator functionality, and was involved in almost every aspect of the capstone.
